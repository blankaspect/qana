### blankaspect/qana

This repository contains the source code of the Qana application except for packages that are shared between Blank
Aspect projects, which can be found in the [blankaspect/common](https://github.com/blankaspect/common) repository.  Not
all the classes of the 'common' packages are required to build the Qana application.  Both sets of code conform to the
Maven standard directory layout \(ie, the sources are in `src/main/java` \).

The Java version of the source code is 1.8 \(Java SE 8\).

All the source files in this repo have a tab width of 4.  You can set this when viewing individual files on GitHub by
appending `?ts=4` to the file's URL.  It's almost effortless. 

The complete source code of the Qana application is distributed, along with an executable JAR and an
installer, through SourceForge:  
<http://qana.sourceforge.net/>

The distribution contains an Ant file for building the application from source and creating a JAR file.  The source code
is published on GitHub so that it can be browsed without the need to download an archive and extract its contents.

You may use any of the source code under the terms of the GPL version 3 license.

<small>This repository doesn't contain anything apart from source code because I didn't want to publish the entire
contents of my local repo.  Git doesn't allow partial clones, so this repository is managed though a secondary local
repo and some scripting.  Until I find an efficient way of publishing a specified subset of the contents of my local
repo, updates of this one will be infrequent, and commits are likely to have collective \(and uninformative\)
comments.</small>
